# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description 
The purpose of this challenge was to utilise the skills we learned in this weeks bootcamp by creating a portfolio website from using Bootstrap 5 following a set of acceptance criteria.

The motivation for this project was to take all the key learning in the third week of lessons and put them to use in a real world scenario by building a personal portfolio that will be used as a digital CV to showcase all coding projects that I am currently working on and building throughout the bootcamp.

The project was built to consolidate knowledge and usage of HTML, CSS and Bootstrap best practices. It was also used to design a complete website, with links, headers, images while being fully responsive and utilising the latest components from the Bootstrap 5 framwork.

This project solves key problems such as making a the website responsive and look professional across any device. The layout is simple and follows best practives for web development by using a header, hero section, main content area and a footer. 

Key learnings: 

1. Use Bootstrap to build website structure
2. How to use basic git commands such as add, commit and push to save changes in a repository such as Github
3. Use css selectors to change the formatting of the webpage and add custom design
4. Reduce the use of media queries
5. Follow the provided documentation on the bootstrap website to ensure the portfolio is built with the suggested best practices
6. How to upload the code to a Github pages site and use the inspect tool to see how the code works.
